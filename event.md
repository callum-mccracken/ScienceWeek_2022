# The Event Display bit

What we want:
- Semi-circle ATLAS you can walk through
- Clickable tracks / calorimeter hits / etc

Models (see [event_cad](event_cad) when they're uploaded):
- surrounding detector stuff (have it, [atlas_cad](atlas_cad))
- event data (working on this):
    - have a root file of data
    - convert that to phoenix-readable data
    - open in phoenix
    - export as obj to import to aero
- descriptive text boxes on each part of the event (e.g. click on a muon track, text pops up to say it's a 100GeV muon)
