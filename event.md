# The Event Display bit

What we want:
- Semi-circle ATLAS you can walk through
- Clickable tracks / calorimeter hits / etc

Models:
- surrounding detector stuff (have it, should play with what to show)
    - can we make it toggle-able like in phoenix?
- event data (need to get)
- clicky bits with text on each part of the event


How to get event data (I'm working on this):
- have a root file of data
- convert that to phoenix-readable data
- open in phoenix
- export as obj to import to aero
