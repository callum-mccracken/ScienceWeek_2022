# The ITk bit

What we want:
- Full inner tracker view (maybe floating above like the big NSW)
- Petal exploded on a table

Models: (see [itk_cad](itk_cad))
- full inner tracker (I'll see if I can get the new one, otherwise extract from [atlas_cad](atlas_cad))
- surrounding detector stuff, maybe (see [atlas_cad](atlas_cad))
- full petal (have, in itk_cad, need to make exploded view)
