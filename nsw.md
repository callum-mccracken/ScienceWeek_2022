# The NSW bit

What we want:
- big ol wheel on the cieling with surrounding detector stuff
- sector calibrated on the poster
- cut-away view next to it

Models:
- full wheel -- `Small-Wheel*.gltf`, just need one wheel
- surrounding detector stuff -- maybe use `ATLAS.glb`
- sector (might have it somewhere)
- cut-away (may need to make this custom)
- small model of wheels in context with main detector
