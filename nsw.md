# The NSW bit

What we want:
- wheel on the ceiling, maybe with surrounding detector stuff (sort of like that image on the mac desktop) if it'll fit
- sector calibrated on the poster
- cut-away view next to it

Models: see [nsw_cad](nsw_cad)
- full wheel -- `Small-Wheel*.gltf`, just need one wheel
- surrounding detector stuff -- use the files in [atlas_cad](atlas_cad)
- sector (might have it somewhere)
- cut-away (may need to make this custom)
- small model of wheels in context with main detector
