Things currently in here:

- `Small-Wheel-Chambers.gltf`: the detectors themselves
- `Small-Wheel-Hub.gltf`: supportive structure at the centres of the wheels
- `Small-Wheel-NJD.gltf`: supportive structures behind the chambers (closer to interaction point)
- `Small Wheel.glb`: chambers + hub

Things to come later:

- Sector file if I can find it, otherwise maybe we can use `Small-Wheel-Chambers.gltf` and select one of the chambers
- Cathode board files or schematics -- currently looking for these
